NeSy-GeMs (Neurosymbolic Generative Models) is a new workshop at ICLR 2023 with the aim of studying research on the intersection of Neurosymbolic and generative modeling. 

* **Call for Papers released**: Dec. 10th, 2022
* **Paper submission deadline**: Feb. 3rd, 2023 (AoE)
* **Reviews released**: Mar. 3rd, 2023
* **Camera-ready deadline**: Apr. 20th, 2023 (AoE)
* **Workshop date**: May 5th, 2023

We target researchers from different backgrounds. NeSy-GeMs encourages short papers (4 pages) and extended abstracts on recently published work on the following list of topics:

* Neurosymbolic Program Synthesis
* Generative models for discrete structures (e.g., generative models of graphs)
* Generative models with symbolic background knowledge
* Probabilistic circuits and tractable models
* Neural-symbolic reasoning? (e.g., automated program verification and testing)
* Neural probabilistic logic programming
* Semantic Parsing (e.g., text to SQL, text to SPARQL)
* Neurosymbolic Programming languages (e.g., [DeepProbLog](https://github.com/ML-KULeuven/deepproblog), [TerpreT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04428))
* Probabilistic programming tools for Neurosymbolic generative models
* Meta-Learning for Neurosymbolic AI
* Neurosymbolic generative modeling for Interpretable AI
* Structured world models
* Generative object-centric learning
* Applications of Neurosymbolic generative modeling
  * Applications in Natural Language Processing
  * Applications in Computer Vision
  * Applications in Robotics
  * Medical applications
  * Other relevant applications

Researchers in the broader fields of generative modeling and Neurosymbolic AI are also encouraged to submit work, as long as the relevance to the intersection of Neurosymbolic and generative modeling is made clear.
