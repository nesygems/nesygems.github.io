NeSy-GeMs (Neurosymbolic Generative Models) is a new workshop at ICLR 2023 to study research on the intersection of Neurosymbolic and generative modeling. 

* **Call for Papers released**: Dec. 16th, 2022
* **Paper submission deadline**: Feb. 3rd, 2023 (AoE)
* **Reviews released**: Mar. 3rd, 2023
* **Camera-ready deadline**: Apr. 20th, 2023 (AoE)
* **Workshop date**: May 4th or May 5th, 2023

We target researchers from different backgrounds. NeSy-GeMs encourages short papers (4 pages) and extended abstracts on recently published work, including, but not limited to, the following list of topics:

* Neurosymbolic Programming
* Generative models for discrete structures (e.g., generative models of graphs)
* Generative models with symbolic background knowledge
* Probabilistic circuits and tractable models
* Neurosymbolic reasoning
* Semantic Parsing
<!-- * Meta-Learning for Neurosymbolic AI -->
<!-- * Neurosymbolic generative modeling for Interpretable AI -->
* Structured world models
* Object-centric learning
* Applications of Neurosymbolic generative modeling

Researchers in the broader fields of generative modeling and Neurosymbolic AI are encouraged to submit work if the relevance to the intersection of Neurosymbolic and generative modeling is clear.
