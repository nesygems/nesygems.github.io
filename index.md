NeSy-GeMs (Neurosymbolic Generative Models) is a new workshop at ICLR 2023 with the aim of studying research on the intersection of Neurosymbolic and generative modeling. 

* **Call for Papers released**: Dec. 10th, 2022
* **Paper submission deadline**: Feb. 3rd, 2023 (AoE)
* **Reviews released**: Mar. 3rd, 2023
* **Camera-ready deadline**: Apr. 20th, 2023 (AoE)
* **Workshop date**: May 5th, 2023


We target researchers from different backgrounds.  

<!-- * **Machine learning researchers** can present advances in meta-learning, reinforcement learning and program synthesis. AIPLANS offers these participants an opportunity to share their research and learn about new automatic programming languages and techniques for inference.
* **Programming language designers** can give insight into the design and implementation of automatic programming languages and DSLs. AIPLANS offers them the opportunity to gather feedback about design choices, promote the language and engage with their users.
* **Programming language theorists** can present fundamental theory of mechanical reasoning and automatic programming languages, such as functional, semiring or array programming. AIPLANS will help them bridge the gap between theory and practice, and gain insight into the capabilities and limitations of machine learning technology. -->


NeSy-GeMs encourages short papers and extended abstracts on recently published work on the following list of topics:

* Neurosymbolic Program Synthesis
* Generative models for discrete structures (e.g., generative models of graphs)
* Generative models with symbolic background knowledge
* Probabilistic circuits and tractable models
* Neural-symbolic reasoning? (e.g., automated program verification and testing)
* Neural probabilistic logic programming
* Semantic Parsing (e.g., text to SQL, text to SPARQL)
* Neurosymbolic Programming languages (e.g., [DeepProbLog](https://github.com/ML-KULeuven/deepproblog), [TerpreT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04428))
* Probabilistic programming tools for Neurosymbolic generative models
* Meta-Learning for Neurosymbolic AI
* Neurosymbolic generative modeling for Interpretable AI
* Structured world models
* Generative object-centric learning
* Applications of Neurosymbolic generative modeling
  * Applications in Natural Language Processing
  * Applications in Computer Vision
  * Applications in Robotics
  * Medical applications
  * Other relevant applications

Researchers in the broader fields of generative modeling and Neurosymbolic AI are also encouraged to submit work, as long as the relevance to the intersection of Neurosymbolic and generative modeling is made clear.
